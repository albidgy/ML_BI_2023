# Homework 6: Neural networks (intro)

In this work, a neural network ```MLP``` was written to classify images from the __Kuzushiji-MNIST (KMNIST)__ dataset.

Also carried out:
- data normalization;
- selection of the optimal __activation function__:
    - ReLU
    - Singmoid
    - GeLU
    - TanH
- selection of an __optimizer__: 
    - Adam
    - RMSprop
    - Adagrad
- written by ```CustomReLU```.

All modules required for installation are located in ```requirements.txt```.
