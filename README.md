# Homework 1: KNN

In this work a machine learning algorithm is implemented - the __K nearest neighbors method__.
The following methods are implemented in the main file (```KNN.ipynb```):
- binary classification;
- multiclass classification;
- regression.

In addition to the main file, there are two auxiliary (```knn.py```, ```metrics.py```) in which several methods and metrics are written: _compute_distances, predict_labels, accuracy, R_squared, MSE, MAE and etc_.

The K-nearest neighbors method was used on two built-in datasets in the ```sklearn``` library: __fetch_openml__ and __load_diabetes__.

All modules required for installation are located in ```requirements.txt```.
