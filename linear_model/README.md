# Homework 2: Linear models. Gradient descent

In this work, linear regression and classification models were trained under ```gradient descent```. The gradient descent functional has been written. Implementation of ```linear``` and ```logistic``` regression models was carried out.

The evaluation of the quality of the models was evaluated using:
- Linear Regression
  * R^2 score

  * MSE

- Logistic regression
  * precision score
  
  * recall score
  
  * f1 score
  
  * accuracy score
 
 All modules required for installation are located in ```requirements.txt```.
